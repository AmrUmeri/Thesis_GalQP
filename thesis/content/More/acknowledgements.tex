I would like to thank Joseph Ayoub for suggesting me this topic, which perfectly matched my taste in mathematics. I would like to thank also Ã–zlem Imamoglu for  administrating this thesis at ETH Zurich and for her introductory lectures on number theory. Many concepts which found their way in this thesis I have encountered first in the lecture on \emph{p-adic Galois representations} offered by Maxim Mornev in autumn 2019 at ETH Zurich, for which I am very grateful. I did benefit also from the Zoom-lecture on the \emph{geometrization of the local Langlands correspondence} offered by Peter Scholze in 2020. Finally I would like to thank Jared Weinstein, the author of the paper on which this thesis is based, for the discussions via e-mail  and Bianca Morrone for reading a preliminary version of this thesis.
