Fix a prime number $p$ and let $E$ be a finite extension of the $p$-adic numbers $\Qp$.
We study the \emph{perfectoid open unit disk} over an algebraically closed non-Archimedean extension $C$ of $E$. We denote by $\perfc$ the category of perfectoid spaces over $\spa{C}{\Oo_C}$. The disk parametrizes topologically nilpotent elements of the tilt of a perfectoid ring over $C$ and can be understood as a replacement of the affine line in algebraic geometry.\footnote{This is a strong claim.} In fact the perfectoid open unit disk is an $E$-vector space object in the categroy $\perfc$.  By removing certain points of the unit disk we get the \emph{punctured perfectoid open unit disk} which is representable as a perfectoid space and is related to the \emph{adic Fargues-Fontaine curve} via the \emph{tilting equivalence}. The classification of vector bundles on the adic Fargues-Fontaine curve will show that heuristically the curve is a geometrization of $\spec{E}$. There is a quotient of the punctured disk which exists as a \emph{diamond} and whose \'{e}tale fundamental group is the \'{e}tale fundamental group of $\spec{E}$. The entire thesis is based on Jared Weinstein's paper \cite{Weinstein16}. The exposition deviates in many parts from the original reference.% and is self-contained.
